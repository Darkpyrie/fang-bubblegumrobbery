Free basic elevator script for qbox
This is my first attempt at making anything for fivem, so I would expect issues. It works just fine for myself so if there are issues, please do let me know.
I do plan on adding notification support for ox and okok soon enough. I also plan on adding support for other targets such as qb or whatever other suggestions people ask for.
I also wish to implement locales in case of people wanting to use it in different locale servers.

### Dependencies:
 - Qbox/Qbx_core
 - ox_target
 - ox_lib

### Usage:
```lua
Config.PolyDebug = false -- This will draw a preview of where your zones are when set to true
Config.PullUpTime = 3000 -- 1000 = 1 second. This will be how long your screen stays black for while transitioning. Recommend 3000 or higher
```
